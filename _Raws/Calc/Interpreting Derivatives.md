# Interpreting Derivatives

## Increasing Functions

$f(x)$ is increasing whenever $x_1 < x_2$ and $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$, i.e as you go up the $x$ axis the $y$ or function values increase.

$f(x)$ is increasing if the slope on any point on it's graph is positive throughout the function's entire domain.

## Decreasing Functions

$f(x)$ is decreasing whenever $x_1 < x_2$ and $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$, .i.e as you go up the $x$ axis the $y$ or function values decrease

$f(x)$ is increasing if the slope on any point on it's graph is negative throughout the function's entire domain.

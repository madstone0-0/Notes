# Capital Budgeting and Investment Appraisal

## Capital Budgeting

Developing financial plans for long-term investments and determining whether the investments will be valuable.

### Estimating Project Cash Flows

There are several classes of cash flows to consider:
- Investments - Cash outlays required to setup the needed infrastructure.
- Interim Cash flows - Operating cash flows
- Terminal cash flows - Exit cash flows at he end of the project's useful life.

There are basic characteristics of relevant cash flows:
- Cash (not accounting income) flows
- Operating (not financing) flows
- After-tax flows
- Incremental flows

#### Operating Cash Flows

The basic principles for estimating operating cash flows are:
- Ignore sunk costs
- Include opportunity costs
- Include project-driven changes in net working capital
- Include effects of inflation

> Sunk Cost - An unrecoverable past cost that cannot be recovered and so should not affect present actions or future decisions. 

> Opportunity Cost - A benefit forgone by choosing one alternative over another.

> Opportunity costs are relevant costs while sunk costs are not. 

#### Tax Considerations

- Timing of payment of taxes
- Capital Allowances available 
- Timing of claim for capital allowances

##### Timing of Tax payment
- Tax is payable in arrears, i.e. tax for year 1 is payable at the end of year 2.
- Tax is paid in the same year as the profit arises for accounting purposes.

##### Timing of Capital Allowances 
- First claim occurs at the start of the project.
- First claim occurs later in the first year.

##### Dealing with Tax-Allowable Depreciation / Capital Allowances

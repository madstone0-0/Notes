# Data, Information and Knowledge

#### Data

> Raw facts, devoid of context or intent.
> Data can be quantitative or qualitative:

-   Quantitative - Numeric data, the result of a measurement, count or some other mathematical calculation.
-   Qualitative - Descriptive data.

#### Information

> Processed data that possesses context, relevance, and purpose.

#### Knowledge

> Human beliefs/perceptions about relationships among facts or concepts relevant to a particular area of study.
> Knowledge can be viewed as information that facilitates action.

-   Explicit knowledge - Knowledge that can be expressed in to words or numbers
-   Tacit knowledge - Insights and intuition that are difficult to transfer to another person by means of simple communication.

#### Wisdom

> The ability to combine knowledge and experience to produce a deeper understanding of a topic.

## Big Data

> Massively large datasets that conventional data processing technologies do not have sufficient power to analyse them.

# Databases

> A tool that allows for the aggregation and analysis of data

##### Reasons databases are needed

1. Build up of redundant data
2. Potential violation of data integrity
3. Otherwise relying on human memory to store and search for needed data

## Data Models and Relational Databases

##### Data Model

> The Logical structure of data items and their relationships

#### Relational Database

> A Database model where data is organized into tables (relations).

###### Field

> A criterion which defines the structure of data stored in each table

###### Record

> An instance of a set of fields in a table

###### Primary Key

> A unique field that denotes each separate record

###### Foreign Key

> A primary key that has been referenced in another table

### Normalization

> To design a database in a way that reduces data redundancy and ensures data integrity

#### 1st Normal Form

#### 2nd Normal Form

#### 3rd Normal Form

### Data Types

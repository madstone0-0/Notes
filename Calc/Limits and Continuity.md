# Limits and Continuity

A function's limit can be one of it's own outputs. When this happens the function called a continuous function.

A Limit of a function is not necessarily one of the function's output values.

A Limit of a function can be one of the function values.

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\
\end{align*}
$$

Then we can say that function is continuous at $x = a$

This means for a function to be continued at $x=a$

-   $f(a)$ must exist
-   $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ must exist
-   $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a)$

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to1} (x^2+2x+1)
\end{align*}
$$

This function is continuous.

## Algebraic Test for Limits

## Graphical Check of Continuity

A graph with no breaks is continuous. Graphically a continuous function should have none of the following.

-   Holes - A holes in a graph are called removable discontinuity, because they can be determined by studying neighbouring values using Limits.
-   Jumps - Jump discontinuity, due to a sudden change in values.
    -   $$ \begin{align*}\begin{cases} x^2, & \text{if } x <1 \\ x+ 4, & \text{if } x \geq 1 \end{cases} \\ \end{align*} $$

## Information System

An information system refers to a group of interconnected components, e.g., hardware, software, data, etc., that work together to collate, store, process, and disseminate information, typically in service of a business or organization.

### Components of Information Systems

Five major components

-   Hardware
-   Software
-   Data
-   People
-   Processes

#### Technology

The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes

##### Hardware

The tangible, physical portion of an information system.

##### Software

The set of instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

-   Application - Allows users to perform productive tasks
-   Operating - Provides the interface between the hardware and application software

##### Data

A collection of facts.

#### Networking Communication

##### People

Front-line user support staff, system analysts, developers, and chief information officer (CIO).

##### Processes

A series of steps undertaken to achieve a desired outcome or goal.

### Role of Information Systems

#### Mainframe Era

Late 1950s - 1970s

-   Room-sized business computers with several machines linked together
-   Primarily used to organize and store large volumes of information, e.g., scientific calculations and accounting.
-   Expensive to buy and maintain, so were used by large firms, universities, and government agencies.
-   Manufacturing Resources Planning (MRP) systems running on mainframes allowed firms also to manage the manufacturing process. Tasks like creating bills of materials and scheduling production.

#### Pc Revolution

-   1975 with the creation of microcomputers
-   Improvements in usability and availability of practical software led to relatively widespread adoption
-   Apple II and IBM PC
-   The proliferation of computer companies and their products drove computer prices down and encouraged innovation
-   These PCs were standalone machines, i.e. not connected to a network
-   IBM PC
-   MS-DOS
-   WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3

#### Client-Server

-   mid 1980s
-   Connecting computers as a way to collaborate and share resources, i.e., client-server
-   Clients were PCs connected to central computers, known as Servers, via Local Area Network (LAN). Servers would determine permissions for each user as a way of managing access to resources.
-   This networking stayed mainly within the confines of each business.
-   The rise of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems (An application with a centralized database that could be used to run a company's entire business)
-   Windows
-   Microsoft Word, Excel

#### The Internet, World Wide Web, and E-Commerce

-   Advanced Research Projects Administration (ARPA) Net.
-   1989 with the development of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee. This became a catalyst for the growth of the Internet as a way for businesses to share information about themselves.
-   Dot-Com bubble burst.
-   The increased speed of data sharing via the Internet led to a rise in malicious software creation and infection.

#### Web 2.0

-   2000s
-   Websites became more interactive as customers wanted more customizability.
-   Website creation became more accessible as the users now did not need to do any programming to make an interactive website
-   Key developments in this stage include Blogging, Social Networking, and Interactive Comments.
-   Disintermediation was rampant, key examples being the decline of physical bookstores, Video rental chains, and the newspaper industry.

###### Disintermediation

The process of technology replacing a middleman in a transaction

#### The Post-PC World

-   With the introduction of the more mobile and easy-to-operate smartphone, PC sales have dropped slightly. Although with this decline in sales, the PC still has a vital role in the business environment.
-   Cloud computing provides users with mobile access to data and applications relegating the PC to more of a part of the communications flow rather than a repository of programs and information.

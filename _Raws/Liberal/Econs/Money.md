## Barter System


### Limitations of the Barter System

#### Double Coincidence of want

For the barter system to work there had two be two parities that wanted what the other had in exchange for what they had.

#### Lack of a common measure of value

In the barter system, there was no common measure of value. This made it difficult to compare the value of goods and services.

#### Lack of divisibility

Some goods and services could not be divided into smaller units. This made it difficult to exchange them for other goods and services.

#### Lack of store of value

Some goods and services could not be stored for a long time. This made it difficult to save them for future use.

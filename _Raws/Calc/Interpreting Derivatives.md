## Instantaneous rate of change

In the case where $f$ is a function of $x$ $f^{\prime}(x)$ measures the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ with respect to $x$.

###### Example

> The term widget is an economic term for a generic unit of manufacturing output.
> Suppose a company produces widgets and knows that the market supports a price of $10 per widget.
> Let $P(n)$ give the profit, in dollars, earned by manufacturing and selling n widgets. The company likely cannot make a (positive) profit making just one widget; the start--up costs will likely exceed $10. Mathematically, we would write this as $P(1)<0$.
>
> What do $P(1000)=500$ and $P^{\prime}(1000)=0.25$ mean? Approximate $P(1100)$.
>
> The equation $P(1000)=500$ means that selling 1,000 widgets returns a profit of \$500.
> We interpret $P^{\prime}(1000)=0.25$ as meaning that the profit is increasing at rate of $0.25 per widget (the units are "dollars per widget.").
> Since we have no other information to use, our best approximation for P(1100) is:
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
>     P(1100) \approx P(1000) + P^{\prime} (1000)  \times 100 \\
> = P(1000) + P^{\prime} (1000)  \times 100 \\
> = 500 + 0.25 \times 100 \\
> &= 525 \\
> \end{aligned}
> $$
>
> We approximate that selling 1,100 widgets returns a profit of $525.

## The Slope of the Tangent Line

We can measure the instantaneous rate of change at a given $x$ value $c$ of a non-linear function by computing $f^{\prime}(c)$. We can determine the behaviour of the function $f$ by observing the slopes of its tangent lines.

## Increasing Functions

$f(x)$ is increasing whenever $x_1 < x_2$ and $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$, I.e as you go up the $x$ axis the $y$ or function values increase.

$f(x)$ is increasing if the slope on any point on it's graph is positive throughout the function's entire domain.

## Decreasing Functions

$f(x)$ is decreasing whenever $x_1 < x_2$ and $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$, .I.e as you go up the $x$ axis the $y$ or function values decrease

$f(x)$ is increasing if the slope on any point on it's graph is negative throughout the function's entire domain.

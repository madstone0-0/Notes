- May - 50,0000 units
- June - 30,000 units
- July - 25,000 units
- August - 15,000 units
The selling price is $10 per unit.
The sales budget for the quarter ending June 30 would be:

|                         | April      | May           | June         | Quarter  |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Budgeted Sales (units)  | 20,000     | 50,000        | 30,000       | 100,000  |
| Selling price per unit  | $10        | $10           | $10          |          |
| Total Sales             | 200,000    | 500,000       | 300,000      | 1,000,000 |

### Expected Cash Collections
Assuming that 60% of sales are collected in the month of sale, 30% in the month following sale, and 10% in the second month following sale, the expected cash collections for the quarter ending June 30 would be:
|                         | April      | May           | June         | Quarter  |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Sales                  | 200,000    | 500,000       | 300,000      | 1,000,000 |
| Collected in month of sale (60%) | 120,000    | 300,000       | 180,000      | | 600,000   |
| Collected in month following sale (30%) |            | | 60,000        | 150,000      | 90,000   |
| Collected in second month following sale (10%) |            |            | 20,000        | 50,000       | 30,000   |
| Total Cash Collections | 120,000    | 360,000       | 350,000      | | 830,000   |
